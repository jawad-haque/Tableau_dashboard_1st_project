# Tableau_dashboard_1st_project
🚀 My First Hands-On Experience on a Tableau Project! 🚀

I’m excited to share my first Tableau dashboard, where I analysed sales report of awesome chocolates in different country. This project was a deep dive into data visualization and storytelling, helping me uncover meaningful patterns from a sample dataset of awesome chocolates and understand the sales report.

🔍 Key Insights:

1.	Business Summary:
   
  i.	Total sales
 ii.	Number of boxes shipped
iii.	Shipment count

2.	Sales by Country: Sales done in different countries.

3.	Top 10 Salesperson: 10 Salesperson who have done the greatest number of sales.

💡 What I Learned:

⭐️How to transform raw data into visual insights using Tableau.
⭐️The importance of interactive filters.
⭐️The power of data storytelling to make complex information accessible.
⭐️How to make charts.
⭐️Formatting charts and text.
⭐️How to make a dashboard with Tableau.

Leveraging Tableau's powerful visualization tools, this dashboard provides a clear and concise view of key data points, making it easier to understand sales report, find out top 10 salesperson and the amount of business done in different countries.

🚀 This is just the beginning of my journey! 🚀 
🚀 I’m excited to continue learning and can’t wait to continue working on more data-driven projects! 🚀
